Operations. 
It records all the Customers who borrowed books and it has all the books stored in the library shelves, their publishers and their categories and the transactions made by the customer. 
Database and Tables: Created a simple library management system with tables for categories, customers, books, and borrow transactions.
Insert, Update, Delete Operations: Demonstrated basic SQL operations for inserting, updating, and deleting records.
Foreign Keys: Established relationships between tables (e.g., books linked to categories, borrows linked to customers and books).
